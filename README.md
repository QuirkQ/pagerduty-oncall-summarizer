# pagerduty-oncall-summarizer
A simple Ruby CLI tool that connects to the PagerDuty API, fetches on-call schedules (with pagination and optional filters), and prints a neat per-user summary of total on-call hours. Highly configurable via command-line flags for date ranges, users, policies, and time zones.
